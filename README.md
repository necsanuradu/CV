# Radu Necsanu

### Profile
Whilst I do not have the developer commercial work experience, I have a good work ethic, I do well with rejection and I am motivated to succeed. I am as passionate about my opinions as I am fascinated about yours, I believe in collaborative work that leads to finding better solutions and ultimately leads to customer satisfaction.

Where will I stand within your company? Well honestly I will try and change it, improve what it is already working, having some code options on the table and you will be tempted to tell me to back off(since you are happy as it is) but please do not, instead you will guide my efforts in the right direction without having to reinvent the wheel but adding wings and thrusters almost forgetting about the principle of equivalence.

Dedicated to driving innovation with the ability to follow industry and technological trends and facilitating early adoption of innovations. Currently seeking a Software Developer role with a reputable organisation.

### Examples
Created a Hotel Management App that worked on a local machine and in the end convinced the management to employ online tech for the job using Little Hotelier. This decision changed all the aspects of the business in positive ways, increasing productivity, sales even if we were not necessarily at the time the most appealing brand on the street. 

With the purpose of ensuring a landing place in the top 3(settable) for us (Springfield Hotel) on Booking.com on the first page using again local means, our own Chrome extension I have developed an exciting and perfectly calibrated way of updating the prices on Little Hotelier in real time based on a report produced while mining Booking.com for months ahead.

As a developer so often in need of a regular expression and never tacking the time to learn the whole concept out of scope for the code I was working on but repeating the same route a couple of times I believed in the opportunity to created a web app that generates regular expressions using user input in a human readable way(https://doregex.com) with all the options one can think of.
