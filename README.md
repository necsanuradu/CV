# Radu Necsanu

Javascript, PHP, Ruby(on Rails), React, SQL, HTML, CSS(+Bootstrap, Sass, Less), Git. Testing Jasmine, Jest, Rspec

### My code
Is a part of me, of my way of thinking showing the best of me in visible terms of speed and vision. It used to be all over the place doing its job. Now, after Makers my code should be nice and dry, short but descriptive and surely well tested.

### Before Makers
Before Makers, I have worked in the Hotel Industry(while being a freelancer/web developer), studied Materials Science and Engineering and worked as a gas engineer for a short period of time.

### Why software development
I can not see my self doing anything else and extend as much of me into it, enjoying every single second of overwhelming rigour.

### Job values
* _Trust - trust that what I do counts and makes a real impact for the company._<br />
* _Honesty - the truth always reveals itself anything but the truth about the state of things it is just an unaffordable delay._<br />
* _Patience -  to listen, to teach and learn from others whilst adding my own spin._<br />
* _Output - every single line of code can be discussed, questioned and needs to be thoroughly tested._<br />

### Strengths
* _I have a strong imagination that can compile huge collections of data._<br />
* _I am good at breaking ideas into smaller concepts that allows me to move through the context at different levels without getting lost._<br />
* _I am good at covering all angles of a proposed solution thinking ahead but coding the present._<br />
* _I am good at asking the right questions._<br/>
* _I see things that other might miss and putting us together will always expose more of our progress._<br />
* _I am good at admitting when I am wrong._<br />
