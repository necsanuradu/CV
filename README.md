### My code
Is a part of me, of my way of thinking showing the best of me in visible terms of speed and vision. It used to be all over the place doing its job. Now, after Makers my code should be nice and dry, short but descriptive and surely well tested.

### Before Makers
Before Makers, I have worked in the Hotel Industry(while being a freelancer/web developer), studied Materials Science and Engineering and worked as a gas engineer for a short period of time.

### Why software development
I can not see my self doing anything else and extend as much of me into it, enjoying every single second of overwhelming rigour.

### Job values
* _trust - that what I do counts and makes a real impact for the company._<br />
* _honesty - the truth always reveals itself anything but the truth about the state of things it is just an unaffordable delay._<br />
* _patience -  to listen, to teach and learn from others whilst adding my own spin._<br />

### Strengths

* _analytical - I seek and analyse information to inform decisions based on the best available evidence._<br />
* _efficient - I convert resources into results in the most efficient and economical way._<br />
* _improver - I look for better ways of doing things and enjoy coming up with new and original ideas._<br />
* _learner - I am inquisitive, I seek out new information and look for new ways to develop myself._<br/>
* _problem solver - I take a positive approach to tackling problems and find ways to identify suitable solutions._<br />
