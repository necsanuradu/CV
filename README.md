## Personal Profile
After working in the Hotel Industry for several years and doing some freelancing as a developer I have decided to change careers and follow my passion for coding. Seamlessly in this world everything has measure, meaning, every line of code has purpose and everything can be achieved employing the right tools. I have worked with a few programming languages but that it is not important what is important is that my skills born with or developed in time are congruent with scripting that is language agnostic, dry while test driven, object oriented, short but descriptive whether in Javascript, PHP, Ruby(on Rails), React, SQL, HTML, CSS(+Bootstrap, Sass, Less) or testing in Jasmine, Jest, Rspec. Simply I can not see my self doing anything else and extend as much of me into it, enjoying every single second of overwhelming rigor.
I expect mutual trust, collaboration, honesty and underlying patience. I will bring with me unconditionally: adaptability, analytical skills, efficiency, self-learning capabilities, resilience and responsibility.

### Case study
* In my previous work place(hotel) from scratch, knowing nothing about programming I have managed to create a Hotel Management App that worked on a local machine and in the end convinced the management to employ online tech for the job using Little Hotelier. This decision changed all the aspects of the business in a positive way, increasing productivity, sales even if we were not necessarily at the time the most appealing brand on the street.
* Same work place with the purpose of ensuring a landing place in the top 3(settable) for us on Booking.com on the first page using again local means, our own Chrome extension I have developed an exciting and perfectly calibrated way of updating the prices on Little Hotelier in real time based on a report produced while scanning Booking.com for months ahead.
* As a developer so often in need of a regular expression and never tacking the time to learn the whole concept out of the scope of current code I was working on but repeating the same route a couple of times I believed in the opportunity to created a web app that generates regular expressions using user input in a human readable way(https://doregex.com) with all the options one can think of.
* As a developer I have written libraries(https://httpraw.com) for PHP trying to couple it definitively to Javascript as it should be since the latter one is not optional. That allowed me to write huge amounts of code years ago(code that as performance could not be beaten today whether in PHP or Javascript), still delivers as expected to this day and I have used that in the projects I have worked on after. Like this web application(https://httpasap.com) that enhances the workplace communication and workflow control, it allows file encryption(creating one of the best algorithms for encryption out there), priority selection, level access etc.
* As a developer on my final project with Makers Bootcamp I had to work for personal reasons on my own and only for a week out of the two and still was able to produce a full game in React much like Candysaga called Golfsaga,  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ykPGalD2YX1kKSb5L4isNVCJyruWRjsm/view?usp=sharing.

## Hobbies
* _Tennis, I always enjoy playing it, you could say that I know very little about it but this did not stopped me from starting to teach my daughter how to play it and with great results too._
* _I write poetry sometimes when I get the call however I do not read that much poetry since I feel it is distorting the way I write knowing that usually I am in the state of mind of absorbing/scanning quickly for information or emerging patterns and retaining them. I have published a book in 2016 and it is in the Romanian language._
